# Script Cleanup Summary

## Removed Scripts (Irrelevant/Incorrect)

The following script files have been removed as they were either redundant, incorrect, or referenced non-existent functionality:

### 1. Removed Scripts:
- `acceptance_demo.sh` - Complex demo script with outdated configurations
- `build_original.sh` - Duplicate of build.sh with incorrect executable references
- `config_manager.sh` - Incomplete configuration management tool
- `manual_verify_step_by_step.sh` - Overly complex manual verification script
- `send_external_data.sh` - External data sending script with wrong MQTT config
- `test_corrected_mqtt.sh` - Redundant MQTT testing script
- `test_mqtt_client.sh` - Duplicate MQTT client testing functionality
- `test_mqtt_reception.sh` - Redundant MQTT reception testing
- `test_mqtt.sh` - Basic MQTT test with incorrect configuration
- `test_real_scenario.sh` - Complex scenario test with outdated references

### 2. Reasons for Removal:
- **Incorrect MQTT Configuration**: Many scripts used port 1883 instead of the project-specified port 2000
- **Missing Authentication**: Scripts didn't include the required vEagles/123456 credentials
- **Non-existent Executables**: Referenced programs like `boat_pro_test` that don't exist
- **Redundant Functionality**: Multiple scripts doing similar MQTT testing
- **Outdated Topic Structure**: Used old topic naming conventions

## Remaining Scripts (Updated and Corrected)

The following scripts have been kept and updated with correct configurations:

### 1. Core Scripts:
- **`build.sh`** - Main build script with correct MQTT examples
- **`run_tests.sh`** - Updated to use actual test executables
- **`test_mpc_client.sh`** - MPC client testing (already had correct config)

### 2. MQTT Testing Scripts:
- **`mqtt_demo.sh`** - Real-time MQTT communication demo
- **`mqtt_full_test.sh`** - Comprehensive MQTT functionality testing
- **`mqtt_quick_check.sh`** - Quick MQTT functionality verification

### 3. Updates Made:
- **MQTT Configuration**: All scripts now use:
  - Host: 127.0.0.1
  - Port: 2000
  - Username: vEagles
  - Password: 123456
- **Topic Structure**: Updated to use correct MPC/GCS topic hierarchy
- **Authentication**: All mosquitto commands include proper credentials
- **Executable References**: Updated to reference actual built programs

## Usage

The remaining scripts provide a clean, focused set of tools for:
1. Building the project (`build.sh`)
2. Running tests (`run_tests.sh`)
3. Testing MQTT functionality (`mqtt_*.sh`)
4. MPC client testing (`test_mpc_client.sh`)

All scripts now align with the project's MQTT architecture as documented in the README.md.
